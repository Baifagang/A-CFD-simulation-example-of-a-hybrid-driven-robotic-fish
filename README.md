# A-CFD-simulation-example-of-a-hybrid-driven-robotic-fish
A CFD simulation of a hybrid actuated robotic fish is presented. It models the transition from a static state to steady swimming speed through self-propulsion. Transient calculations, configured via UDF, set the tail swing frequency and thruster rotational speeds on both sides.
